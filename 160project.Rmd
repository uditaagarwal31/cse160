This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data1 <- read.csv("C:/Users/matts/Downloads/HuluRaw.csv", header=TRUE)
data_cleaned <- subset(data1, select = c("show.canonical_name", "show.description", "show.episodes_count", "show.genres", "show.name", "show.rating", "show.seasons_count", "show.is_coppa", "show.company.name", "show.company.canonical_name",            "show.show_rollups.current.highest_rating",  "show.show_rollups.current.seasons_count", "show.show_rollups.current.released_at", "show.show_rollups.current.episodes_count", "show.show_rollups.subscriber.highest_rating"))
head(data_cleaned)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
